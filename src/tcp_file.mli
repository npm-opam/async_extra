      bound tcp socket on port that will be used to serve files to clients.  The unit
      Deferred will be filled when the server is ready to receive clients.

      The [auth] function will be called once for every client connection.  If it returns
      false the client will be disconnected immediately.  Further details of [auth] can be
      found in the documentation for [Rpc.serve].

      again.

      interested by calling [Pipe.close_reader].  See [Rpc.Pipe_rpc.create] for the
      definition on ?client_pushes_back and its implications. Passing the
      client_pushes_back argument will have no detrimental effect on a server that
      is delivering from a file. If the client caught up, effectively tailing the file,
      then the server will enqueue the data in memory until the client catches up, or gets
      disconnected.
