(* File_tail is useful for pulling data from a file that is being appended to by another
   process.  Creating a file tail returns the reader half of a pipe whose writer half is
   populated by a background process that roughly does the following loop.

   {v
     loop:
       stat to find out if data is available
       read data (repeatedly [ open, seek, read, close ] until all data is read)
       wait for some time
   v}

      will always be closed. *)
  type t =
    | File_replaced
    (** [File_replaced] occurs if the inode of the file changed and the file tail was
        configured with [ignore_inode_change = false]. *)
    | File_shrank
    (** [File_shrank] occurs if [stat] detects that the length of the file decreases from
        one call to the next. *)

        data from the file, because the data being read has null ('\000') characters.  The
        span is how long it has been attempting to read and been getting nulls.  This
        warning will only occur if [retry_null_reads = true].  This warning will be

        not contain null reads. *)

(** [create file] creates a [File_tail.t] that will immediately begin reading [file], and
    then will start the stat-read loop.

    [read_buf_len] sets the size of the internal buffer used for making read system calls.

    [read_delay] sets how long the stat-read loop waits each time after it reaches eof
    before stat'ing again.  Setting [read_delay] too low could cause unecessary load.

    If [retry_null_reads = true], then reads that return data with null ('\000')
    characters are ignored and cause the system to delay 0.2s and attempt the read again.
    If [retry_null_reads = false], then the file tail will process data with nulls just as
    it would any other data.

    If [break_on_lines = true], the file tail will break data into lines on '\n'.  If not,
    the fill tail will return chunks of data from the end of the file as they are
    available.

    If [ignore_inode_change = true], the file tail will silently press on when the
    [file]'s inode changes.  If not, an inode change will cause the file tail to report an
    error and stop.  CIFS changes inodes of mounted files few times a day and we need
    [ignore_inode_change = true] option to keep tailers watching files on it alive.

    [start_at] determines the file position at which the file tail starts.

    [eof_latency_tolerance] affects the [Did_not_reach_eof_for] warning.

    [null_read_tolerance] determines how long the tailing must observe null reads
    before it will report a [Delayed_due_to_null_reads_for] warning.
