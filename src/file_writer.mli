(** [File_writer] is a thin wrapper around [Writer] with a couple of extra features:

    - It keeps track of all the file writers that have been created so that it can
    iterate over them to find out how many bytes in total they have to write.
    - It keeps track of whether the underlying writer has failed, and if so silently
    ignores future operations.  This can prevent pointlessly filling up a writer's
    buffer with data that will never go anywhere.
