(** Simple cpu usage statistics.

    Samples are calculated as [du/dt] once a second where:

    {v
      du = Used user + system time since last sample
      dt = elapsed "wall clock" time since last sample
    v}

    That is, each sample is the average cpu usage of the program over the last second.

    be calculated.  The underlying data structure adapts to keep a sufficiently large
    history of samples to calculate summaries for all windows.  The pipe will deliver one
    update per window per second.  Window durations are rounded up to the nearest second.
